# EcosystemStimulator
This Java program stimulates a simple ecosystem in which plants, sheep and wolves all live together. As time passes, the user can observe the changes in population of all three species.

The user must run "Ecosystem.java" and then enter the size of ecosystem, number of organisms, health, and spawn rate.
